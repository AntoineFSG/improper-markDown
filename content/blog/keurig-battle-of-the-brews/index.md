Keurig’s Battle of the Brews was a social/digital campaign and sweepstakes to find America’s favorite Keurig Brewed® beverage through a bracketed tournament held at the same time as the NCAA’s March Madness college basketball tournament,capitalizing on the buzz that the month-long tournament generates.

The campaign was held between March 3rd, 2015 and April 13th, 2015. Users were drawn to the dynamic keurigbattleofthebrews.com microsite through promotion on social media, keurig.com e-mail, and partner promotions. Users were invited to vote on their favorite flavor through a gamified and animated “match up” screen on the microsite, clicking their favorite K-Cup pod in a series of match-ups to cast their vote. Every week, the winning K-Cup pods were selected and the brackets adjusted.

We revived the campaign with a clean-sheet redesign of the web experience, user flow, and promotional tactics, resulting in a 283% increase in unique participants and a 353% increase in sweepstake entries. Additionally, our return rate was extremely high for a branded online activation: nearly half of all visitors returned to the site during the campaign’s run.
