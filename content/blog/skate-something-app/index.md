SKATESOMETHING.COM The Skate Something site started off as a place to find skate spots locally in NYC. Spring-boarding off the gorilla marketing campaign “If You See Something, Skate Something” which was a parody of the NYPD anti-terrorism slogan. This grew into a brand of T-shirts, posters, stickers and later a map application.

As the founder of skatesomething.com, Ian partnered with a small team and who started Shredlabs LLC which developed a fully functioning skateboarding spot app for mobile and desktop. It helps you find the best local skate spots, rate them, and add photos, comments, and details. You can create your own spots and share with friends, building a social network of local skaters.
